# Space-Fight
Space Ship Fight Simulation (MATLAB)

This was my first time using 3D visualization
with matlab. The ships are placed in a 1x1 cube with each other. Each ship is
represented by a dot on a 3D graph, a scatter plot. Each ship has a laser weapon
attached that can destroy the other ship if it is within an angle of 45 degrees and
distance of 0.3. The ships will maneuver around each other in a random fashion. The maneuvering of the ships can be
observed in the 3D graph that updates with the movement of each ship. Something to
note, the 3D graph adjusts dynamically based on where the ships are located. After each
ship movement the distance and angle between them is also printed out. Once one ship
has destroyed the other a message will be displayed declaring which ship was the
winner. The ships are ship 1 and ship 2. On rare occasions it is possible for the ships to
reach a stalemate where neither was able to destroy the other.
